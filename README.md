# Music Phone

This is a fun project that will play a .wav file after answering a phone.
I have it running on a ([raspberry pi0w](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)) 
with ([this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076CPX4NN) modem.

The fw directory is where the a build should be launched and it has instructions for doing so
The phone directory contains the logic for initializing the modem, answering, and playing files
